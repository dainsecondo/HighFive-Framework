# HighFive-Framework [Work In Progress...]
This is the addon folder where to put every tool the framework needs but that we don't own the rights!
```
PHPLiveX - Async PHP Functions
PHPLive.php | phplivex.js

ZeroClipboard - Copy/paste on the fly with a click
ZeroClipboard.min.js | ZeroClipboard.min.map | ZeroClipboard.swf
```
These files are needed depending on what you need.
