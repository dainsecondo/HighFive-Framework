# HighFive-Framework [Work In Progress...]
A new modular (NO MVC!) library for any existing and new project, created from scratch or with other scripts/frameworks!
```php
$HF->class->function();
$HF->class->classVar;
```
You can create any file you need, just name the file as you want the class name and prefix the class name with "HF".
Example, we want to create a car class:
```
1. Create a file named "car.HF.php" into the "/lib" folder
2. Create a class: "class HFcar{ ... }"
Now You can access to it with $HF->car->vars / functions();
```
That's it.

Cool, uh?
