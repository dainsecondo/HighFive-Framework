# HighFive-Framework [Work In Progress...]
A new modular (NO MVC!) library for any existing and new project, created from scratch or with other scripts/frameworks!

$HF->class->function();
$HF->class->classVar;

You can create any file you need, just name the file as you want the class name and prefix the class name with "HF".
Example, we want to create a car class:
1. Create a file named "car.HF.php" into the "/lib" folder
2. Create a class: "class HFcar{ ... }"
That's it.
You can access it with $HF->car->vars / functions();

Cool, uh?
